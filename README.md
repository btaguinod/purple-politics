## Purpose

Purple Politics is a website designed to help you understand all perspectives on recent political events.

Political events in the US are usually marked as positive for Democrats or Republicans. However, these events are too complex to be labeled as one side or the other. The ethics behind each story cannot be boiled down to just **blue** or **red**.

Rather, they are **purple**. A mix of both political sides.

By giving you **media biases**, **text emotion**, and **text sentiment**, this website gives you a deeper view into the ethical complexity of an article.

This allows you to decide for yourself where your beliefs stand, allowing you to form an option that aligns with your beliefs rather than the beliefs of singular sources.
